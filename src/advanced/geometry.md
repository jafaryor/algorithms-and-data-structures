## Computational Geometry
__Computational geometry__ is the branch of computer science that studies algorithms for solving geometric problems.

In modern engineering  and mathematics,  computational geometry has applications in such diverse fields as computer graphics,robotics,  VLSI design,  computer-aided  design,  molecular  modeling,  metallurgy,manufacturing, textile layout, forestry, and statistics.

We  look  at  a  few  computational-geometry  algorithms  in  two dimensions,  that  is,  in  the  plane. Computational geometry can also apply to three dimensions, and even higher-dimensional spaces,but such problems and their solutions can be very difficult to visualize.

We  represent  each  input  object  by  a  set  of points `{p_1, p_2, p_3, ...}` where  each `p_i = (x_i, y_i)` and `x_i, y_i âˆˆ R`.

Problems the computational geometry solves:
1. Cross Product
2. Determining whether two line segments intersect
3. Determining whether any pair of segments intersects
4. Finding the convex hull
5. Finding the closest pair of points
