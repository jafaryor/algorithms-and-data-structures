## Approximation Algorithms
Many problems of practical significance are NP-complete, yet they are too important to abandon merely because we don’t know how to find an optimal solution in polynomial time. Even if a problem is NP-complete, there may be hope. We have at least three ways to get around NP-completeness.
1. If the actual inputs are small, an algorithm with exponential running time may be perfectly satisfactory.
2. We may be able to isolate important special cases that we can solve in polynomial time.
3. We might come up with approaches to find near-optimal solutions in polynomial time (either in the worst case or the expected case).

We call an algorithm that returns near-optimal solutions an __approximation algorithm__.
