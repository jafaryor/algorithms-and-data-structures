## Queue
Queue is a dynamic set where, the element deleted is always the one that has been in the set for the longest time: the queue implements a _first-in_, _first-out_, or `FIFO`, policy.

The queue has a __head__ and a __tail__. When an element is enqueued, it takes its place at the tail of the queue, just as a newly arriving customer takes a place at the end of the line. The element dequeued is always the one at the head of the queue, like the customer at the head of the line who has waited the longest.
