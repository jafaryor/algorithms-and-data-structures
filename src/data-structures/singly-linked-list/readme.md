## Singly Linked List
A linked list is a data structure in which the objects are arranged in a linear order. Unlike an array, however, in which the linear order is determined by the array indices, the order in a linked list is determined by a pointer in each object.

Each element of a singly linked list `L` is an object with an attribute key and the pointer attribute: `next`􏰅.
