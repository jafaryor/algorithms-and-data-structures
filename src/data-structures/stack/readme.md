## Stack

Stack is a dynamic set where, the element deleted from the set is the one most recently inserted: the stack implements a _last-in_, _first-out_, or `LIFO`, policy.

The INSERT operation on a stack is often called `PUSH`, and the DELETE operation, which does not take an element argument, is often called `POP`. These names are allusions to physical stacks, such as the spring-loaded stacks of plates used in cafeterias. The order in which plates are popped from the stack is the reverse of the order in which they were pushed onto the stack, since only the top plate is accessible.
