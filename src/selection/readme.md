# Selection Algorithm
Selection algorithm is an algorithm for finding the _`k`th smallest number_ in a list or array; such a number is called the _`k`th order statistic_. This includes the cases of finding the _minimum_, _maximum_, and _median_ elements.

The __`i`th order statistic__ of a set of `n` elements is the ith smallest element. For example, the __minimum__ of a set of elements is the first order statistic (`i = 1`), and the __maximum__ is the nth order statistic (`i = n`). A __median__, informally, is the “halfway point” of the set.
