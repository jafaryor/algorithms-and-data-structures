## Tetmins:
* __online algorithm__ - is one that can process its input piece-by-piece in a serial fashion, i.e., in the order that the input is fed to the algorithm, without having the entire input available from the start.

* __in-place algorithm__ - is an algorithm which transforms input using no auxiliary data structure. The input is usually overwritten by the output as the algorithm executes. In-place algorithm updates input sequence only through replacement or swapping of elements.

    An algorithm which is not in-place is sometimes called __not-in-place__ or __out-of-place__.

* A sorting algorithm is __stable__ if it preserves the original order of elements with equal key values

* __adaptive sort__ - if it takes advantage of existing order in its input. It benefits from the presortedness in the input sequence – or a limited amount of disorder for various definitions of measures of disorder – and sorts faster.

* __subroutine__ is a sequence of program instructions that performs a specific task, packaged as a unit.

* __tail call__ is a subroutine call performed as the final action of a procedure. If a tail call might lead to the same subroutine being called again later in the call chain, the subroutine is said to be __tail-recursive__, which is a special case of recursion.
